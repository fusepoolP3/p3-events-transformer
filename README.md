Fusepool P3 Events Transformer
============================

The transformer uses data about events from different sources and makes it available as RDF.
A data set must be sent via HTTP POST to the transformer with the url of an XSLT file for its 
transformation into RDF. The transformer will return the result RDF data to the client.
